### **Phase 5: AIReview** 🤖
**Status:** `AIReview`

#### **Responsibilities:**
✅ **Select 3 different AI models for review**
✅ **Each model must generate detailed report**
✅ **Fix critical issues found**
✅ **Document improvements implemented**
✅ **Ensure approval from all 3 models**

#### **Deliverables:**
- 3 AI review reports
- Critical issues fixed
- Improvement documentation
- Quality approval by AI

#### **Advancement Criteria:**
- [ ] **3 different AI models reviewed the code**

## 🔧 Available MCP Tools

### **Workflow Management:**

#### **`advance_workflow_phase`**
Advances the task to the next workflow phase.
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-uuid"
}
```

#### **`set_technical_documentation`**
Sets the path to technical documentation (Planning phase).
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-uuid",
  "doc_path": "/docs/technical-spec.md"
}
```

#### **`set_test_coverage`**
Sets test coverage percentage (Testing phase).
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-uuid",
  "coverage": 0.95
}
```

#### **`add_ai_review_report`**
Adds AI review report (AIReview phase).
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-uuid",
  "model_name": "GPT-4",
  "review_type": "CodeQuality",
  "content": "Detailed review content...",
  "score": 0.9,
  "approved": true,
  "suggestions": ["Suggestion 1", "Suggestion 2"]
}
```

## 📊 Progress Monitoring

### **Workflow Status:**
- 🔴 `NotStarted` - Task created, waiting to start
- 🟡 `Planning` - In planning/documentation phase
- 🟡 `InImplementation` - In code implementation
- 🟡 `TestCreation` - Creating test suite
- 🟡 `Testing` - Executing tests
- 🟡 `AIReview` - In AI review
- 🟢 `Completed` - Task completed successfully
- 🔴 `Failed` - Task failed quality criteria

### **Quality Metrics:**
- **Test Coverage:** >= 90%
- **AI Review Score:** >= 0.8 (per model)
- **Maximum Time per Phase:** 2 business days
- **Success Rate:** 100% of tests passing

## 🚨 Mandatory Rules

### **1. Mandatory Sequence**
❌ **DO NOT SKIP PHASES** - Each phase must be completed before advancing
❌ **DO NOT GO BACK** - Once advanced, phase cannot be reverted
❌ **DO NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT APPROVAL** - AIReview requires approval from 3 models

### **2. Minimum Quality**
❌ **NO EXCEPTIONS** - All tests must pass
❌ **NO COMPROMISES** - Coverage < 90% = failure
❌ **NO PARTIAL APPROVALS** - All 3 AI models must approve

### **3. Documentation**
❌ **NO DOCUMENTATION = BLOCKAGE** - Incomplete Planning blocks implementation
❌ **NO REPORTS = FAILURE** - AIReview requires detailed reports

2. Confirm documentation/tests were created
3. Validate tests are passing

### **Workflow Stuck:**
1. Use `get_task` to see current status
2. Check error messages in logs
